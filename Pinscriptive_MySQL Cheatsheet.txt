1. Delete query with join in MySQL
Answer : DELETE a FROM `ALLERGY` a join avm_non_matched_patients p on a.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH=p.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH;

** Reference links: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15026368/mysql-delete-query-with-join
DELETE FROM Test2
WHERE Field2 IN (
    SELECT Field2 
    FROM Test1
    WHERE Field1 = 22)

2. Update bulk records based on matching criteria with where consition
Answer: 

Update IMS_LRX_AmbEMR_Dataset.IMS_HCV_PATIENTS 
set GENOTYPE = (SELECT GENOTYPE FROM PATIENT_GENOTYPE_9k WHERE IMS_HCV_PATIENTS.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH = PATIENT_GENOTYPE_9k.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH)
WHERE PATIENT_ID_SYNTH in (SELECT PATIENT_ID_SYNTH from PATIENT_GENOTYPE_9k);

            SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
               UPDATE `PATIENT_MEDICATIONS` SET IDW_PATIENT_ID_SYNTH=(SELECT distinct IDW_PATIENT_ID_SYNTH FROM IMS_HCV_PATIENTS WHERE PATIENT_ID_SYNTH = PATIENT_MEDICATIONS.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH)
               WHERE PATIENT_ID_SYNTH in (SELECT PATIENT_ID_SYNTH from IMS_HCV_PATIENTS)

			   Solution: 

update IMS_HCV_PATIENTS_TEMP a
join Sahil_Predicted_Genotype b on a.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH = b.PATIENT_ID_SYNTH
set a.GENOTYPE = b.GENOTYPE_PREDICTED
