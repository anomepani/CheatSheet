13. bash: cannot create temp file for here-document: No space left on device / Intelisense is not working in linux or tab is not working
Solution :
Reference link : https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/277387/bash-cannot-create-temp-file-for-here-document-no-space-left-on-device
Reference link : https://askubuntu.com/questions/380238/how-to-clean-tmp


Solution :
The directory /tmp means temporary.

This directory stores temporary data. You don't need to delete anything from it, the data contained in it gets deleted automatically after every reboot.

Still if you want to delete the data present in it use

sudo rm -r /tmp/*

deleting from it won't cause any problem as these are temporary files.

16. check-linux-disk-usage-of-files-and-directories

1. To find out the disk usage summary of a /home/tecmint directory tree and each of its sub directories. Enter the command as:
du  /home/tecmint
2. Using “-h” option with “du” command provides results in “Human Readable Format“. Means you can see sizes in Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes etc.
du -h /home/tecmint
3. To get the summary of a grand total disk usage size of an directory use the option “-s” as follows.
du -sh /home/tecmint
4. Using “-a” flag with “du” command displays the disk usage of all the files and directories.
du -a /home/tecmint
du -ah /home/tecmint
du -k /home/tecmint
du -m /home/tecmint
du -mh /home/tecmint

The “-c” flag provides a grand total usage disk space at the last line. If your directory taken 674MB space, then the last last two line of the output would be.

du -ch /home/tecmint
 The below command calculates and displays the disk usage of all files and directories, but excludes the files that matches given pattern. The below command excludes the “.txt” files while calculating the total size of diretory. So, this way you can exclude any file formats by using flag “-–exclude“. See the output there is no txt files entry.
du -ah --exclude="*.txt" /home/tecmint

Display the disk usage based on modification of time, use the flag “–time” as shown below.

du -ha --time /home/tecmint
